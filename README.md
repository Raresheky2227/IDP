# IDP ‚Äì Event Manager Microservices Project

Project for University.

## üöÄ Quickstart

### 1. Build All Backend Services

Some tests are currently unstable and may fail, so use:

```
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

Run this command **in each backend service folder** (`auth-service`, `event-service`, etc).

---

### 2. Start the Backend (Gateway + Microservices)

From the `gateway` directory, start everything with Docker Compose:

```
docker compose up --build
```

- **Gateway:** [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)  
  (All API endpoints are routed through this gateway)

---

### 3. Start the Frontend

In the `event-manager-frontend` folder:

```
npm install
npm start
```

- **Frontend:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

### 4. (Optional) Mailhog Notifications

- **Mailhog (Email testing):** [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025)
